            <p>At the Fantastic Squad Playroom, we thrive when being outdoors. The educators and parents all have significant roles when it comes to our outdoor play portion. As most of our emergent curriculum is taken outside this gives the children a chance to take risks, make new games and become socially and emotionally attuned to nature and our surroundings. Let’s have a look at all the good things being outdoors can offer.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold-paragraph">Promoting children's holistic development:</span> We all know that outdoor play promotes physical skills as children get the opportunity to build their physical strength, endurance, and balance skills through participation in outdoor activities such as running, climbing, and playing a variety of outdoor games. It also helps in the development of social and emotional health as children engage in interactions with their peers during teamwork activities and boosts their confidence. At Fantastic Squad, we offer a variety of outdoor activities as well as free play that include risk taking, exploration and loose part building. It promotes children's cognitive and critical thinking skills along with increasing their risk assessment competencie. The outdoor loose parts play area with materials such as cardboard boxes, crates, fabrics, old tires and much more, inspires children to create, direct and take on different roles in their play. We can see the children's creativity flourishing as they use and manipulate the materials and share their ideas with their peers.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <h3>Understanding the children’s unique capabilities and talents while outdoors:</h3>
            <p>Every child is unique in their own way as we truly know here at Fantastic Squad Playroom. We celebrate the uniqueness of each child by offering a variety of activities including things like risk taking, exploration and loose part building while outdoors.</p>
            <p>We really inspire to create our own sort of adventure playgrounds and really see the children’s true colors come out. We are grateful for the outdoor space we have as there are many chances for children to climb trees, walk on uneven surfaces, and learn social emotional development through play.</p> -->

            <p><span class="italicize">“Children's social, emotional, cognitive and physical health is influenced by their connection to nature. Children are hardwired to need nature and to be part of natural environments. In nature, children can build significant relationships with each other, their animal friends and with the adults who care enough to make sure that they spend time outside.”</span> (Dietze & Kashin, 2019, p.3).</p>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold-paragraph">Improving children's learning outcomes: </span>The outdoors is calming as well as inspiring. It provides the opportunity for children to make connections with the real world and develop an understanding of different concepts such as changes in seasons, plant life, insects and animals. Children can focus more on their studies and other activities if they engage more in outdoor play. We are grateful for the outdoor space we have as there are many chances for children to climb trees and walk on uneven surfaces while engaging in risky play. Risky play is crucial for the overall development and improving children's learning abilities. Watch the following video to learn more about it.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold-paragraph">Helping families and parents learn and grow their own outdoor play experiences: </span>We all remember the fun times we had while playing with our friends outdoors. Helping you understand the importance of outdoor play in children’s early childhood development is our main priority at Fantastic Squad Playroom. Children grow and learn to try new things while we invite the parents to also try these things whether they are new to them or It takes them back to their own childhood. We love to inspire parents to be just as creative as their children.</li>
