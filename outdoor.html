            <p>At the Fantastic Squad Playroom, we thrive when being outdoors. The educators and parents all have significant roles when it comes to our outdoor play portion. As most of our emergent curriculum is taken outside this gives the children a chance to take risks, make new games and become socially and emotionally in tune with nature and our surroundings. Let’s have a look at all the good things being outdoors can offer.</p>

            <h3>Understanding the children’s unique capabilities and talents while outdoors:</h3>
            <p>Every child is unique in their own way as we truly know here at Fantastic Squad Playroom. We celebrate the uniqueness of each child by offering a variety of activities Including things like risk taking, exploration and loose part building while outdoors.</p>

            <p>We really inspire to create our own sort of adventure playgrounds and really see the children’s true colors come out. We are grateful for the outdoor space we have as there are many chances for children to climb trees, walk on uneven surfaces, and learn social emotional development through play.</p>

            <h3>Helping families and parents learn and grow their own outdoor play experiences:</h3>
            <p>Helping you understand the importance of outdoor play in children’s early childhood development is our main priority at Fantastic Squad Playroom. Children grow and learn to try new things while we invite the parents to also try these things whether they are new to them or It takes them back to their own childhood. We love to inspire parents to be just as creative as their children.</p>
